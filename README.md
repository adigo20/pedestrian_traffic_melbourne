Created an interactive R shiny visualisation on the pedestrain traffic data in Melbourne CBD. The key objective was to indetify the following -  <br>
i - Locations with most traffic. <br>
ii - Peak hours. <br>
iii - Allowing user to individually select the locations using dropdown. <br>
iv - Identiying which day had the most pedestrian traffic. <br>

# Observation and overview - 
Based on the Visualisations it was observed that the nearby locations to the City loop railway station had the most pedestrian traffic. 
Apart from that a peak was seen between 8 - 10 am and 5-7 pm during the weekdays. Weekend as predicted had less traffic in general.
